{\#} we found that changes associated with two communities merging or with one of several communities losing its internal connections ({\textquotedblleft}fragmentation{\textquotedblright}) were more difficult to accurately detect than those associated with one community splitting in two or with many singletons connecting to form a new community ({\textquotedblleft}formation{\textquotedblright})

{\#} change-point methods based on network measures like the mean degree, clustering coeffi- cient, or mean geodesic path length performed poorly, yielding high false negative rates even for large structural changes}
